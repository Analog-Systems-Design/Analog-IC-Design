    <h2>1. Mosfet Large & Small Signal Model</h1>
    We neglected short channel effect  & large VDS effect by using large L=1um and small vds=250mV and we also neglected bodyeffect by grounding the source

    <p>
    to calculate gm as our small signal was of 1mV amplitude 
    so X2=VGS+1mV, Y2=I(X2) and X1=VGS-1mV, Y1=I(X1) 
    and then gm=dI/dVGS = dY/dx = 5.1e-5 mhos

    <p>
        Our output resistance upper bound is controlled by the value of ro so we can't increase rout than ro where we can find value of ro from simulation with name of gds where gds=1/ro like in figure below
    </p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>
    so we cannot increase our Rout more than 23.523Kohms and also we cannot increase Vds very much to increase ro because this will lead to gate loses its control over the drain current
    </p>
    <p>
    We can model our work above by this model in figure below

    </figure>
    <p>
    Short Channel effects changes the relation between Mosfet drain current and VGS as in case of long channel we use the famous quadratic equation where if we derive transconductance from this equation we find that it is linear which means that it increases with VGS.<br/>
    While in case of short channel the relation between mosfet drain current and VGS becomes linear which means that if we drive transconductance we will find that it is of constant value.

    </figure>
    <p>
    short channel effect affects the value of ro where it increases very much in this case which leads to high gain but Vgs loses control
    </p>
    <h2>2. Basic Amplifier Stages</h2>
    <p>
    we have three basic amplifier toplogies which are:
    <ul>
    <li>Common Source(CS): which acts as Voltage and current amplifier if we inject the signal from the gate and probing on Drain. where source is <mark>common</mark> between Drain and Gate</li>
    <li>Common Gate(CG): which acts as Voltage amplifier and Current Buffer, Buffer means amplifier of gain=1</li>
    <li>Common Drain(CD) or Source Follower(SF)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
        Let's summarize all types of analysis to study amplifier parameters,
        we have two types of analysis whether you are doing it by hand or on
        simulator like cadence spectre simulator.
    </p>
        <h4>2.1.1. Large Signal Analysis</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Voltage Gain</li>
            <li>Current Gain</li>
            <li>Input Resistance</li>
            <li>Output Resistance</li>
            <li>Bandwidth</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>2.1.2 Small Signal Analysis</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bias Point</li>
            <li>Signal Swing</li>
            <li>Distortion</li>

    <h4>2.1.3. Direct Analysis on Schematic</h4>

    </figure>
     <p>
       We can simplify our solution instead of every time removing every transistor and
       draw its small signal model in order to deal with very large circuits that contains
       alot of mos transistors. so first we can remove the vccs gmVgs & gmVbs and add them
       and put them of mosfet drain branch.<br/>
       to simplify more, we found that in most cases gate node is grounded when we are calculating
       small signal model and also we always make the bulk grounded to neglect body effect so that means
       that Vgs=Vbs so we can gm & gmb together in a single gm so delta_Id=(gm+gmb)delta_Vgs
     </p>

    </figure> 
    <h4>2.1.4. Common Approximations we usually use:</h4>
    <p>
        intrinsic gain >>>1 because it is the max gain we can reach and these 
        approximations are relative for example you can find (1/gm)~=100Kohms
        which is very large but you will find also that ro=10Mohms thats why I said
        that approximations are relative 
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h4>2.1.5. Rin/Rout Shortcuts</h4>
    <p>
        We can simplify the way we use when when we try to find input resistance and output resistance
        of the amplifier, like as follow in figure below we can focus on three parts: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>R_LFS: Resistance when looking from source</li>
        <li>R_LFD: Resistance when looking from drain</li>
        <li>Gate_resistance: is always very large so we doesn't care about calculating it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        as in figure below: 
    </p>
    <figure>
        <center><img src="images/basicamplifierstages/equivalentresistance.png"/></center>
        <caption><em>Credits: Prof. Hisham Omran</em></caption>
    </figure>
    <h5>2.1.5.1. Resistance Looking From Drain</h5>
    <p>
       The eye determines the that I want to see output resistance infront of the red vertical line opposite
       to it, we will find in this case the gate is grounded which means that vgs is only controlled by 
       the voltage drop resistance Rs==>Vgs=-Ix*Rs and we can also neglect body effect as Vgs=Vbs because gate is grounded
       so we can add gm & gmb to each other while calculating but keep in mind that they are of different 
       values. always try to solve as much as possible on the drawing instead of writting many equations,<br/>
       after all these simplifications we have now only one equation left which is KCL @ node D<br/>
       which is:$$i_x ={ (g_m+g_{mb})*(-i_xR_s)+{v_x-i_xR_S \over r_o}}$$
       $$R_{LFD}={v_x \over i_x}={r_o+[(gm+gm_b)*r_o+1]R_S}={{r_o}+({g_m}+{g_{mb}}){r_o}R_s+R_s}=r_o[1+(gm+gm_b)R_s]+R_s$$
       $$neglecting R_s: then, R_{LFD} \sim = r_o[1+(gm+gm_b)R_s]$$
       which can get from it easily Vx/Ix which corresponds to 
       the value of resistance looking from drain we can neglect Rs comparing to gm*ro<br/>
       we can only put gmb=0 when Rs=0 where we will not have body effect
    </p>

        <caption><em>Credits: Prof. Hisham Omran</em></caption>
    </figure>
    <p>
       We can say by this derivation that drain is acting like a high impedance node and to summarize we get
       the following equation in figure and its special Case 
    </p>

        <center><img src="images/basicamplifierstages/resistancelookingfromdrain2.png"/></center>

    </figure>
    <h5>2.1.5.2. Resistance Looking From Source</h5>
    <p>
        when looking from source we have same condition on gate where Vbs=Vgs & delta_Id=gm*delta_Vgs
         but the voltage on source node will differ because we replaced rs with a voltage source of value Vx 
         and of current Ix which is injected to mosfet so Vgs=Vg-Vs=0-Vx=-Vx and to explain how idrain=isource
         we can say that mosfet acts like a supernode where by conservation law of charge we can tell that the current
         that entered this node from the source, it will exit also from drain  after all these simplifications what
         remains now is performing a kcl at source of mosfet.<br/>
         KCl @ node S: $$i_x={(g_m+g_{mb})*v_x}+{ v_x-i_x*R_D \over r_o}$$
         $$ R_{LFS}={v_x \over i_x}={1 \over {gm+gmb+{1 \over r_o}}}*{(1+{R_D \over r_o})}= {1 \over {g_m+g_{mb}}}*{(1+ {R_D \over r_o})}$$
         $$R_{LFS}={1 \over {g_m+g_{mb}}}*{(1+{R_D \over r_o})}$$
         $$ (@RD=0)$$ $$R_{LFS}={1 \over {g_m+g_{mb}}}$$
         which means that source acts like low impedance node and this connection @Rd=0 we call it diode connected(gate and drain connected)
        because @ this case vds=vgs which means that it is now not a voltage controlled current source and changed to a resistor of 1/gm
        because id=gmvgs=gmvds====>R(diode connected)=Vds/Ids = 1/gm we call it also source absorbtion<br/>
        in terms of large signal analysis the diode connected mosfet is always at saturation because vds=vgs and the condition
        for saturation is Vds>Vgs-Vth which will always be satisfied
         <!--  $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$ -->

    </figure>
    <p>
        for below quiz we are trying to calculate Resistance when looking from source for a three cascoded mosfets in order
        to calculate it we will first start with mosfet that is connected to ground in small signal analysis which is Vdd node in
        case of Pmos as in figure below after calculating rseen from each mosfet we substitute the mosfet in the drawing with
        derived R_LFS and then continue on the preceding mosfet and so on, you will find the answer in below quiz is very strange as 
        R_LFS=ro while we said before that resistancelookingfromsource is a low impedance node but ro is of very high impedance
        and this occured due to cascoding transistors which raises our attention to the effect of cascode stages in the future when
        we are talking about amplifiers

    <p>
    Lets model above figure with mathematical equations:
        $$InputResistance: R_{in}={v_{in} \over {i_{in}}}$$
        $$Output Resistance: R_{out}=R_{thevenin}={v_x \over i_x} @vin=0$$
        $$v_{out,opencircuit}=v_{thevenin}=A_v*v_{in}$$
        $$OpenCircuitVoltageGain: A_{v_{opencircuit}}={v_{out,opencircuit} \over v_{in}}$$
        $$i_{out,shortcircuit}=i_{Norton}={{G_m}*v_{in}} @vout=0$$
        $$TransConductance: G_m={i_{out,shortcircuit} \over v_{in}}$$
        $$Norton to Thevenin: v_{out,opencircuit}={A_v*v_{in}}={i_{norton}*R_{out}}={({G_m}{v_{in}})}{R_{out}}$$
        $$A_v={v_{out,opencircuit} \over v_{in}}={G_m}{R_{out}}$$
        $$ShortCircuitCurrentGain: A_i={i_{out,sc} \over i_{in}}={i_{out,shortcircuit} \over {{v_{in}} \over R_{in}}}={{G_m}R_{in}}$$
    </p>
    <h4>2.2.1 Voltage Amplifier model Equations</h4>
    <p>
        Lets summarize these equations as follow:
        $$R_{in}={v_{in} \over i_{in}}$$
        $$R_{out}={v_x \over i_x} @ v_{in}=0$$ 
        $$G_m={i_{out,shortcircuit} \over v_{in}} @v_{out}=0$$
        $$A_v={{G_m} R_{out}}$$
        $$A_i={{G_m}R_{in}}$$
    Remeber that we can get first two equations of Rin& Rout from shortcuts that we learned before all remaining will be is 
    calculating transconductance using norton method and then at the end we can get voltage & current gain this method of 
    solution we call it divide and conquer where we simplified large problems into many small problems that we could solve it
    independent of each other

            small signal analysis with rout=inf. by using ideal current source, first item you start 
            to debug in simulation is the bias point because all preceding parameters depend on it
         </p>

        </figure>
         <p>
            you wil find vout(red curve) is larger than vin and also of phase difference of pi
            when I bias with current source I no longer need to adjust Vds and worry about its effect on
            gate voltage for losing control over the electron channel
         </p>
         <h5>2.3.1.3 Hand Analysis</h5>
         <p>
            First draw current branch on mosfet drain branch and draw ro in parallel with Vds
            and vbs connect it to ground away from the circuit as in figure below
        </p>
         <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>
            Second combine gm*vgs and gmb*vbs because gate is grounded and then combine them
            in a single gm*vgs and calculate vout by applying kvl on the loop between vout and gnd
            to obtain vout like in figure below which is equal to Vout=-(gm*Vgs)*ro and vin = Vgs
            then we can obtain voltage gain(Av)=Vout/Vin=-gm*ro which demonstrates the results
            that we obtained in the simulation

    I removed dc value when plotting output by subtracting the output voltage from the average of the total signal using cadence calculator, you will find that they change in phase to explain this:<br />
    when <mark>vgs increases drain</mark> current increases which affect vout precedingly as voltage drop on resistance increases which makes <mark>Vout decreases</marK> thats why they have phase difference of pi==(180 degrees)

        vds problem starts to rise here when we put finite resistance on the drain where it made
        the amplifier with very low gain and when we increase Rout we can't increase it than ro=23.523Kohms

    <h5>Transconductance</h5>  
    <p>
        first to calculate transconductance as we said before we will use norton method when we make vout=0(short circuit)
        as in above figure and calculate iout,sc where now RD will disappear from our calculation because it is parallel with
        a short circuit and the current will be equivalent to the mosfet drain current where we can get mosfet drain current
        as follow:
        $${i_{out,shortcircuit}}={-{g_m}{v_{gs}}+{{v_s} \over {r_o}}}$$
        $$and, {v_{gs}}={{v_g}-{v_s}}=v_{in}-v_s$$
        $$then,{i_{out,sc}=-g_{m}{(v_{in}-v_s)}+{{v_s} \over {r_o}}}$$
        $$and, {v_s}=-{{i_{out,shortcircuit}}Rs}$$
        $$then, {i_{out,sc}}=-g_{m}{(v_{in}-(-{{i_{out,sc}}Rs}))+{-{{i_{out,sc}}Rs} \over {r_o}}}$$
        $$then, {i_{out,sc}[1+{g_{m}R_s}+{{R_s} \over {r_o}}]}=-{g_m}{v_{in}}$$
        $$then, transconductance=G_m={i_{out,sc} \over v_{in}}={-{g_m} \over {[1+{g_{m}R_s}+{{R_s} \over {r_o}}]}}$$
    </p>
    <h5>outputResistance</h5>  
    <p>
        to calculate Rout which is equivalent to thevenin resistance where we will close any independent sources and try
        to use Rin/Rout shortcuts:
        $$R_{LFD}=r_{o}[1+(g_{m}+g_{mb})]R_s$$
        $$R_{out}={R_{LFD}||R_D}={{R_D}||{{r_o}[1+(g_m+g_{mb})R_s]}}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        from above equations we could now determine voltage gain and current gain where:
        $$Voltagegain: A_v={{G_m}{R_{out}}}$$
        $$Currentgain: A_i={{G_m}R_{in}}$$
    </p>
    <h5>Output Resistance Cases</h5>
    <p>
        we could have three cases to for RD:
        <ul>
            <li>if RD is ac o.c.(currentsource): voltage_gain=-gm*ro</li>
            <li>if RD <<<< RLFD: </li>
        </ul>  
    </p>

        <h4>3.1.1. Small Signal Analysis</h4>
        <h5>3.1.1.1 TransConductance</h5>
        <p>
            schematic below shows a simple model of cascode amplifier which we will try to calculate its parameters
            like before as follow(notice that we neglected ro of M1 and remember that common base acts like current buffer):
            $$i_{out,sc}=-{g_{m1}}v_{in}$$
            $$G_{mtotal}={i_{out,sc} \over v_{in}}=-g_{m1}$$
            Same Gm of CommonSource amplifier
        </p>
        <p>
            We can solve it also in another way by solving each stage independently like solving first CommonSource stage and try
            to get inorton you will find it is equal to -gm1 and rout seen from source of M2 as follow:
            $$i_{norton,Shortcircuit}=-g_{m1}v_{in}$$
            $$Transconductance_{firstStage}=-g_{m1}$$
            $$i_{norton,shortcircuit}=-g_{m1}v_{in}$$
            $$Transconductance_{secondStage}=-g_{m1}$$
        </p>
        <h5>3.1.1.2. Output Resistance</h5>
        <p>
            $$R_{LFDofM1}=ro1$$
            $$R_{LFDofM2}=r_{o2}[1+(g_{m2}+g_{mb2}R_{LFDofM1})]$$
            $$R_{outtotal}= \infty(currentsource) ||R_{LFDofM2}=R_{LFDofM2}=r_{o2}{[1+(g_{m2}+g_{mb2}r_{o1})]} \sim ={(g_{m2}+g_{mb2})}{r_{o1}}{r_{o2}}$$
            Rout is significantly boosted by that voltage gain is significantly boosted
        </p>
        <p>
            Second Method:
            $$R_{LFSofM2}={1 \over {g_m+g_{mb}}}*{(1+{R_D \over r_o})} where R_D= \infty ,so, R_{LFSofM2}=\infty$$
            $$OutputResistance_{firststage}=R_{LFSofM2}||r_{o1}=r_{o1}$$
            $$R_{LFDofM2}=r_{o2}[1+(g_{m}+g_{mb})]R_s$$ 
            $$where,R_s=0,because, v_{x}=0(Thevenin condition),so,R_{LFDofM2} \sim =r_{o2}$$
            $$OutputResistance_{secondstage}=\infty || R_{LFDofM2}=r_{o2}$$
        </p>
        <h5>3.1.1.3. Voltage Gain</h5>
        <p>
            First Method:
            $$A_v =G_{mtotal} R_{outtotal} \sim = -{g_{m1}(g_{m1}+g_{mb2})r_{o1}r_{o2}}$$
            by assuming all gm and ro are equal and neglecting body effect we can get:
            $$A_v=-(g_m r_o)^2$$
        </p>
        <p>
            Second Method:
            $$VoltageGain_{M1}=A_{v1}=G_{m1}*R_{outofm1}=-g{m1}*r{o1}$$
            $$VoltageGain_{M2}=A_{v2}=G_{m2}*R_{outofm2}=-g{m1}*r{o2}$$
            $$TotalVoltageGain={v{out} \over v_{in}}={v{out} \over v_{x}}*{v{x} \over v_{in}}=A_{v1}*A_{v2}=-(g_m r_o)^2$$
        </p>
        <h4>3.2. Large Signal Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            how Vbias affects the circuit and what do I need from it? first I use it to keep M1 in sat and 
            to keep M1 in sat we need Vds1>Vgs1-Vth1 where the worst case is at the largest value of Vgs because this case will
            put limits on V<sub>B</sub> to keep M1 in sat so:
            $$V_B>V_{GS2}+V_{DS1,max},Where, V_{DS1,max}={V_{overdrive,max}=V_{in,max}-V_{Th1}}$$
            $$Then, V_B>V_{GS2}+(V_{in,max}-V_{Th1}) $$
            second thing I need from V<sub>B</sub> is to keep also M2 in sat where:
            $$to keep M2 in sat: V_{DS2}>V_{GS2}-V_{TH2},by removing S_2 from both sides then V_{D2}>V_{G2}-V_{Th2}$$ 
            $$where, V_{G2}=V_B, and, V_{D2}=V_{out}, then, V_{out}>{V_B-V{Th2}}$$
            $$then, V_B < {V_{out,min}-V_{Th2}}$$
            where V<sub>out,min</sub> is the minimum voltage required to keep M1,M2 sat which is equal to 2V<sub>overdrive</sub>
            by combining our derived limits we get:
            $$V_{GS2}+(V_{in,max}-V_{Th1}) < V_B < {V_{out,min}-V_{Th2}}$$ 
            which means that limits on output range is oppositely coupled with input range as condition of V<sub>out,min</sub>
            must be larger than V<sub>in,max</sub> + V<sub>GS2</sub> for same threshold voltage in order to specify an amount for
            V<sub>B</sub> if this doesn't happen we will either hurt input or output range
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            when we use finite Resistance R<sub>D</sub> by that we remove the effect of boosting R<sub>out</sub> so what
            do I got benefitted from using cascoded transistors in this case we are increasing voltage gain but it will 
            affect the bandwidth of the circuit which we will discuss later on

        <h4>3.3.1. Small Signal Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            If we want to keep the large R<sub>out</sub>, we must use cascode load why not a current source because
            in real life there is nothing called ideal current source but we create current source using transistors 
            and why not using single stage because output resistance of the load will be small compared to o/p resistance
            of the driving cascode so it will act like previous case of using finite R<sub>D</sub><br/>
            assuming all g<sub>m</sub> and r<sub>o</sub> are equal and neglecting body effect we can get:<br/>
            $$A_v=-{(g_m r_o)^2 \over 2}$$ we divided by two because R<sub>out</sub> seen from the load in this case is 
            equal to R<sub>out</sub> seen from the driver in this case so total R<sub>out</sub> is equivalent to parallelism
            of them
        </p>
        <h4>3.3.2. Large Signal Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            We are concerned about it now because we are now talking about a circuit that 
            can be implemented in real life so we are concerned about biasing the circuit correctly, we now that 
            for every transistor its drain-source voltage must be greater than overdrive voltage so:
            $$ V_{DSM4}+V_{DSM3}=V_{DD}-V_{SM4}+V_{SM4}-V_{out}=V_{DD}-V{out}>2*V_{ov}$$
            $$then, V_{out} <{ 2*V_{ov} }$$
            to make M3 & M4 stays in sat region(upper limit)<br/>
            and also:
            $$ V_{DSM1}+V_{DSM2}=(V_{out}-V_{SM1})+(V_{SM1}-0)=V_{out}>2V_{ov}$$
            to make M1 & M2 stays in sat region(lower limit)<br/>
            and you can remember also the other parameters in large signal analysis by returning in index or you can
            continue with me we are now concerned with output swing. which we can calculate from upper, lower limits
            where outputswing=upperlimit-lowerlimit= V<sub>DD</sub>-4V<sub>ov</sub> which is demonstrated in figure below:
